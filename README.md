    <code>@gekkotadev</code>'s Godot Game Template

    <i>There are many like it, but this one is mine.</i>

<hgroup>

A Godot game template with a subjectively sensible set of defaults to serve my
own needs â€” but maybe it'll work for your needs too. It assumes VS Code as your
IDE, comes pre-configured with a default set of add-ons, and set up with what I
perceive to be a good enough project structure to get started with.

Not optimized for any particular genre or type of game, just a general starter.
