# My Game's Documentation & Development Logs

Technical documentation intended for developers (not a wiki) and development
logs detailing the progress of the game. Generated with MkDocs[1]

    [1]: MkDocs is selected for its low barrier to entry and high ease of use
         enhanced by the framework's thriving ecosystem of packages. In
         addition, it can be safely assumed that Python is installed on a
         developer's system.
